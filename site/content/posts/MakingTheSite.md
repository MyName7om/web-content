After many failed job applications, I have decided the best case of action is to create a website. Both to showcase my personal projects, and to distract me from reflecting over the number of applications I am yet to hear back from.

# What I used

To create the site I used Hugo, GitHub (for GitHub Pages) and I used the theme hugo-coder*. I am editing the mark down files using Neovim, I have recently discovered Neovim and I am using the creation and maintenance of the website and future projects to get acquainted with the vim motions.

# The Plan 

The plan for this website is to showcase what I have done and what I am planning to do. Some current examples are:
- Configuring Neovim 
- Creating a simple Neovim plugin
- Installing and using ProxMox with a Raspberry Pi
- Making an IRC server with Tor
